## 🎯 **Overview**  
**push_swap** is a project at **[1337 Coding School](https://1337.ma)** (part of the **42 Network**) where you create a program to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. This project teaches you how to implement **sorting algorithms**, **stack manipulation**, and **optimization techniques** in C. It’s a great way to understand how to solve problems with constraints and limited resources.

## 🧠 **What You'll Learn**  
- **📖 Sorting Algorithms**:  
  Learn how to implement and optimize sorting algorithms like **quicksort**, **insertion sort**, and **merge sort**.  
- **🧩 Stack Manipulation**:  
  Use two stacks (`stack_a` and `stack_b`) and a limited set of operations to sort the data.  
- **⚙️ Optimization**:  
  Minimize the number of operations to achieve the best possible performance.  
- **🧠 Problem Solving**:  
  Develop strategies to handle edge cases and large datasets efficiently.

## 🚀 **Features**  
- **✅ Core Functionality**:  
  - Implement a program that sorts a stack of integers using the following operations:  
    - `sa` (swap a): Swap the first two elements of stack A.  
    - `sb` (swap b): Swap the first two elements of stack B.  
    - `ss` (swap both): Perform `sa` and `sb` simultaneously.  
    - `pa` (push a): Move the first element of stack B to stack A.  
    - `pb` (push b): Move the first element of stack A to stack B.  
    - `ra` (rotate a): Shift all elements of stack A up by one (first element becomes last).  
    - `rb` (rotate b): Shift all elements of stack B up by one (first element becomes last).  
    - `rr` (rotate both): Perform `ra` and `rb` simultaneously.  
    - `rra` (reverse rotate a): Shift all elements of stack A down by one (last element becomes first).  
    - `rrb` (reverse rotate b): Shift all elements of stack B down by one (last element becomes first).  
    - `rrr` (reverse rotate both): Perform `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously.  

- **✨ Advanced Features**:  
  - Handle edge cases like already sorted stacks, small stacks (3 or 5 elements), and large stacks (100 or 500 elements).  
  - Optimize the number of operations to achieve the best possible score.  

- **📦 Organized Code**:  
  Clean, modular, and well-documented code for easy readability and maintenance.
